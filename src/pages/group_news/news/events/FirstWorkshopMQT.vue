                We are happy to announce that the Millenium Institute for Research in Optics (MIRO) will host in Chile the
                1st international workshop on the emerging topic of molecular quantum technology. The meeting will take
                place late 2019, and will bring together leading experts in the fields of quantum control, condensed-matter
                physics, quantum optics, molecular and chemical physics who are actively looking for ways to exploit
                molecules and molecular materials for the development of novel quantum technology.
