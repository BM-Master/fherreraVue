                This week we said farwell to our first PhD visitor
                <strong>Shanavas Shajahan</strong>, a 4th year PhD student in the
                Department of Physics at Periyar University (India). Shanavas was co-hosted between us and Dinesh Singhâ€™s
                Lab since June 2019. He leaves Chile after successfully carrying out several experiments on the physics of
                metal-organic frameworks for applications in energy storage. We wish Shanavas the best for the rest of his
                PhD studies and hope to see him back in our labs soon. <strong>Farewell Shanavas!</strong>
