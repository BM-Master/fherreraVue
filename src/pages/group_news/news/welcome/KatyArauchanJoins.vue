                We are happy to announce that Katy Aruachan joins us to become the first PhD student in the group! Katy
                received his BSc degree in Physics at Universidad de CÃ³rdova in Colombia (2017), and since then she has been
                dedicated to physics and science teaching. After being admitted to the PhD Physics program in our
                Department, she joined our group to carry out research at the interface of quantum optics, AMO physics and
                chemical physics. We are thrilled to welcome her and look forward to see her make progress on her research
                projects.
