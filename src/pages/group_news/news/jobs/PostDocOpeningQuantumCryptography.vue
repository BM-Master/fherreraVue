                A <strong>fully-funded</strong> postdoctoral position in <strong>computational material science</strong> is
                available for <strong>two-years</strong> at the Molecular Quantum Technology Group of Felipe Herrera, based
                in the Department of Physics at Universidad de Santiago de Chile. The group works on the development of
                large-scale virtual screening algorithms for the
                computational discovery of experimentally-accesible metal-organic frameworks (MOF) that can be used as
                efficient nonlinear optical crystals for quantum communication protocols.
