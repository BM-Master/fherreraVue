                A <strong>fully-funded</strong> postdoctoral position in
                <strong>quantum dynamics of organic materials in optical
                    cavities</strong> is available for <strong>two-years</strong> at the Molecular Quantum Technology Group
                of Felipe Herrera. The position will be
                held in the Department of Physics at Universidad de Santiago de Chile. The Herrera Lab works on the
                development of novel theoretical and numerical frameworks to study the complex quantum dynamics of organic
                materials embedded in optical and infrared optical cavities, in order to address outstanding questions and
                propose new experiments in the emerging field of organic cavity quantum electrodynamics.

            <p class="my-3">
                Ph.D. degree in Chemistry, Physics or similar. Demonstrated knowledge of theoretical and numerical methods
                for studying quantum dynamics of atomic or molecular systems subject to external driving and dissipation.
                Good programming skills in scientific computing languages (e.g. Python, Fortran, Matlab). Familiarity with
                cavity QED theory and/or molecular quantum dynamics is a plus.
