                We are pleased to offer a postdoctoral position on <strong>machine learning for materials
                    discovery</strong>, with applications in optical quantum communication.
            </p>
            <p class="my-3">
                The position is available for up to <strong>three-years</strong> in our Molecular Quantum Technology Group,
                based in the
                Department of Physics at Universidad de Santiago de Chile. The group currently works on the development of
                large-scale virtual screening algorithms for the computational discovery of experimentally-accesible
                metal-organic frameworks (MOF) that can be used as efficient nonlinear optical crystals for quantum
                communication protocols. In this project, we collaborate very closely with experimental groups on
                nanomaterials synthesis, laser spectroscopy, and quantum optics.
