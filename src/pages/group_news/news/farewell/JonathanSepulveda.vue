                <strong>Farewell Jonathan Sepúlveda.</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="my-3">
                Jonathan was admitted as a graduate student at Universidad del País Vasco (Spain) and the Materials Physics
                Center (San Sebastian), to pursue PhD studies in physics, working on theoretical quantum nanophotonics under
                the supervision of
                <a href="https://cfm.ehu.es/team/javier-aizpurua-iriazabal/">Javier Aizpurua</a>. We wish Jonathan a successfull and productive PhD experience.
            </p>
            <p class="my-3">
                Jonathan joined our group in 2015 as an undergraduate research student, defended his BSc Engineering Physics
                thesis on Finite-Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulations for optical nanoantennas in 2018, and then
                continued with us to pursue a MSc degree in physics. He successfully defended his MSc thesis on
                computational macroscopic quantum electrodynamics for applications in strong light-matter coupling
                phenomena, which ultimately helped him get accepted in his PhD program.
            </p>
            <p class="my-3">
                <strong>Well done Jonathan!</strong>
            </p>
